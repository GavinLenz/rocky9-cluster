# Rocky 9.6 Micro-Cluster Automation

This repository contains the full automation stack I use to stand up a
Rocky Linux 9.6 micro-cluster: PXE provisioning, Slurm scheduler, validation
(Pavilion2), and supporting documentation. Everything is codified through Ansible so
nodes can be rebuilt from bare metal in minutes.
